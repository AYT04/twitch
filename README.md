# AYTWiki - BETA

This is BETA SOFTWARE, so expect bugs and misconfigurations.

I plan on updating this later, and actually using this as a project. For now, it's just my Twitch UI Front End.

```bash
sudo ayt install yarn npm hugo go
```

> Note: Hugo & Go aren't necessary, its just if you prefer Hugo and not anything JS related.

```bash
yarn dev
```
